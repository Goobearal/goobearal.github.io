        CSS (cascading style sheet) is how simple and plain html code is transformed into an appealing and attractive site. However, within CSS, it is important to understand the different selectors available to the programmer as well as their specificity in order to have a fluid coding experience.

            <td>This is more specific than type selectors, but less specific than ID selectors. So its CSS stling will be applied instead of styling done with type selectors, but not over styling done with ID selectors.</td>

            <td><span class="weightBold">ID selectors</span> are the most specific of these three CSS selectors. IDs are specific to only one html element, so unlike a class, it won't be applied to multiple html elements if the programmer wants it to.</td>
            <td>This is the most specific, and therefore the CSS styling in this selector takes priority over the other two selectors.</td>
